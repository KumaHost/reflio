    <strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>
    <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Some information — such as your Internet Protocol
    (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected
    automatically when you visit our&nbsp;Website.
  </p>
  <p>
    We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate
    the&nbsp;Website. This information does not reveal your specific identity

    information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics,
    operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name,

    and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to
    maintain the security and operation of our&nbsp;Website, and for our

    <li>
      Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your
      computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access

      application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model
      Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system and

    <li>
      Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your
      device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much
      information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you
      use to access the&nbsp;Website. For example, we may use GPS and other
      technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current
      location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to
      collect this information either by refusing access to the information or
      by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you

      Services.

  <p>
    <strong>2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
  </p>

    grounds we rely on next to each purpose listed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    In legal terms, we are generally the "data controller" under European data
    protection laws since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data
    processing we perform. However, if you are a business customer with whom we
    have entered into a data processing agreement for the provision of corporate
    services to you, then you would be the "data controller" and we would be the
    "data processor" under European data protection laws since we would be
    processing data on your behalf in accordance with your instructions.
  </p>
  <p>We use the information we collect or receive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>To send you marketing and promotional communications.</strong> We
      and/or our third-party marketing partners may use the personal information
      you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with
      your marketing preferences. For example, when expressing an interest in
      obtaining information about us or our&nbsp;Website, subscribing to
      marketing or otherwise contacting us, we will collect personal information
      from you. You can opt-out of our marketing emails at any time (see the "

    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Deliver targeted advertising to you.</strong>&nbsp;We may use your
      information to develop and display personalized content and advertising

      <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information where
      we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law,
      governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal
      process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in
      response to public authorities to meet national security or law
      enforcement requirements).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may disclose your information where
      we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action
      regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud,

  <p>
    <strong>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We may use cookies and other tracking
    technologies to collect and store your information.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and
    pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we
    use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in
    our Cookie Notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</strong>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In Short: &nbsp;</strong>If you choose to register or log in to our
    services using a social media account, we may have access to certain
    information about you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our&nbsp;Website offers you the ability to register and login using your
    third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
    logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
    information about you from your social media provider. The profile
    information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
    concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list,
    profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public on
    such social media platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
    described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on
    the relevant&nbsp;Website. Please note that we do not control, and are not
    responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party
    social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to
    understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and
    how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We keep your information for as long
    as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
    otherwise required by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
    for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
    period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
    legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
    personal information for longer than&nbsp;the period of time in which users
    have an account with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
    information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
    this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
    been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
    possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We aim to protect your personal
    information through a system of organizational and technical security
    measures.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
    measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
    process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
    information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
    storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise
    or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
    parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect,
    access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
    protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to
    and from our&nbsp;Website is at your own risk. You should only access
    the&nbsp;Website within a secure environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In Short:</strong>&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect data from or
    market to children under 18 years of age.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years
    of age. By using the&nbsp;Website, you represent that you are at least 18 or
    that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
    minor dependent’s use of the&nbsp;Website. If we learn that personal
    information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
    deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such
    data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected
    from children under age 18, please contact us at&nbsp;richie@reflio.com.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In Short:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In some regions, such as the European
    Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you
    greater access to and control over your personal information.&nbsp;You may
    review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under
    applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request
    access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
    rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal
    information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain
    circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of
    your personal information. To make such a request, please use the&nbsp;

    </a>{" "}
    provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
    applicable data protection laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you
    have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however
    that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
    withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information
    conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
    processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to
    your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact
    details here:&nbsp;
    <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">

    If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email
    us at&nbsp;richie@reflio.com.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Account Information</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your
    account or terminate your account, you can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete
    your account and information from our active databases. However, we may
    retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
    problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or
    comply with applicable legal requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Opting out of email marketing:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our
    marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the
    emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below.
    You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may
    still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails
    that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to
    respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To
    otherwise opt-out, you may:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your account settings and update your preferences.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
    include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal
    your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
    activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
    such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
    mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
    online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
    this privacy notice.&nbsp;
  </p>

    personal information.

    request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
    information provided below.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a

    your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law,
    such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her

  </p>
  <p>
    We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.
  </p>
  <p>Verification process</p>
  <p>
    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
    determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our
    system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
    information so that we can match it with information you have previously
    provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
    may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
    information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we
    may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that
    you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification
    methods as the circumstances dictate.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
    your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we
    will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
    verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the
    information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
    additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for
    security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
    provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

      you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on

      in accordance with the CCPA.

  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
